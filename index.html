            <div class="FS-Content">
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field Study 1 is the first in a series of six sequential studies in the Bachelor of Elementary Education and the Bachelor of Secondary Education Programs (BEED and BSED) offered by the Teacher Education Institutions (TEIs). Field study 1 is linked with a professional education subject. It is the prerogative of the TEI to match with an appropriate subject such as Child and Adolescent Development, Principles of Teaching, or Facilitating Learning. The focus of Field Study 1 is observation of the learners, school structure and the community. Since this is the first time the student teachers have been exposed to the school environment, they are expected to take note of the school and classroom facilities, and the organizational set-up of the school. The PSTs shall observe the behavior of the learners in the actual learning environment. Based on their observations of learners, PSTs shall develop their understanding on feasible approaches to facilitate learning considering the various phases of growth and development. To assist their transition, the students will be paired with a “buddy”. Included in FS 1 is the enhancement of the students’ communication skills with his/her buddy since they are expected to be adequate in the language they will be using during their hands-on teaching in the remaining field studies</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Classroom Observations</h2>

            <button class="accordion">The Learners</button>
            <div class="panel"><br>
              <p>During my observations at both <b>Integrated Laboratory School</b> and <b>City Central Elementary School</b>, I noticed distinct differences in the learners’ behaviors and attitudes, which highlighted the diversity in learning environments and student characteristics.</p><br>
              <p>At the <b>Integrated Laboratory School</b>, the learners were very intelligent, attentive, and actively engaged in their lessons. They demonstrated a high level of focus and were eager to participate, showcasing their ability to absorb information quickly. These students communicated effectively with their teachers, asking insightful questions and contributing meaningfully to discussions. Their ability to articulate their thoughts reflected a well-developed set of communication skills, and their interaction with their teachers was both respectful and productive. This dynamic facilitated a classroom atmosphere where students felt comfortable and motivated to learn. The learners displayed a good balance between being lively and focused. Although some were energetic, they were still able to channel that energy towards learning, indicating that the classroom environment supported a healthy blend of enthusiasm and attentiveness.</p><br>
              <p>In addition to their academic engagement, the students at Integrated Laboratory School also exhibited strong collaboration skills. They worked well together during group activities, showing mutual respect and openness to one another’s ideas. This cooperative spirit not only enhanced their learning experience but also promoted a sense of community within the classroom. They also displayed a high level of responsibility, taking ownership of their actions and staying focused on tasks. Even when distracted, they would quickly return to their tasks when reminded, demonstrating self-discipline and the ability to manage their behavior effectively.</p><br>
              <p>On the other hand, the learners at <b>City Central Elementary School</b> presented a different set of characteristics. While also full of energy, these students were more playful and often exhibited behaviors that sometimes made it challenging for them to focus on their lessons. They were often described as kiatan (mischievous), and while their enthusiasm was noticeable, it occasionally interfered with their ability to listen attentively to their teacher. However, despite their playful nature, these students showed a sense of responsibility when it came to classroom chores, such as cleaning their environment. They took pride in maintaining the cleanliness of their classroom, which reflected their awareness of shared responsibility and teamwork.</p><br>
              <p>The sense of teamwork among the learners at City Central Elementary School was one of the most notable aspects of my observation. While they might not have always been completely focused during lessons, their ability to cooperate with one another during group tasks or cleaning duties was impressive. They supported each other, demonstrating a strong sense of community within the classroom. Their teamwork and sense of responsibility were essential to the smooth functioning of their classroom, showing that they understood the importance of contributing to the collective success of their peers.</p><br>
              <p>However, the learners at City Central Elementary School did face challenges in terms of maintaining focus during lessons. Their energy and playfulness often distracted them, making it more difficult for them to stay engaged with the lesson. This pointed to the need for more engaging and interactive teaching strategies to help harness their energy more effectively. Incorporating hands-on activities, movement-based learning, or other engaging methods could help redirect their energy into productive academic pursuits. Additionally, strengthening the connection between the teacher and students through interactive discussions and activities might encourage better listening and focus.</p><br>
              <p>In conclusion, the learners at both Integrated Laboratory School and City Central Elementary School displayed unique qualities that made each classroom dynamic in its own way. The learners at Integrated Laboratory School were more focused, disciplined, and communicative, while those at City Central Elementary School showed an abundance of energy, responsibility, and teamwork. Both groups demonstrated potential for growth and success, but each required different approaches from their teachers to effectively guide them in their learning journey. The Integrated Laboratory School students thrived in an environment that encouraged collaboration and self-discipline, while the City Central Elementary School learners needed strategies to better channel their energy and maintain focus. Ultimately, both groups of learners have great potential, and with the right guidance, they can achieve their academic and personal goals.</p><br>

            <button class="accordion">The Teacher</button>
            <div class="panel"><br>
                <p>At the Integrated Laboratory School (ILS), teaching is an exciting and dynamic experience, thanks to the creativity and innovation of the teachers. Instead of just relying on traditional methods, they bring lessons to life by using a wide range of teaching strategies. Whether it’s through group projects, interactive discussions, or hands-on activities, the lessons are designed to capture students' attention and keep them engaged. This creative approach ensures that students not only learn the material but also enjoy the process, making learning feel like an adventure rather than a task.</p><br>
                <p>A key aspect of teaching at ILS is the use of technology. Teachers incorporate digital tools like interactive whiteboards, apps, and online resources to make lessons more engaging and accessible. By using technology, they can present information in visually stimulating ways and offer students a chance to explore the material in different formats. It also helps students develop important digital skills, which are becoming increasingly essential in today’s world. The combination of creativity and technology gives students a richer, more interactive learning experience that goes beyond the basics.</p><br>
                <p>Along with creativity and technology, the teachers at ILS are also skilled at maintaining a positive yet authoritative presence in the classroom. They set clear expectations and create a respectful environment where students feel comfortable but know when to focus. This balance between authority and encouragement helps ensure that the classroom runs smoothly, with students actively participating and paying attention. Teachers guide the class in a way that fosters mutual respect, making sure that students feel valued while also staying on track with their learning.</p><br>
                <p>At City Central Elementary School, the teaching style tends to be more traditional. Teachers usually stand in front of the class and provide direct instruction, explaining concepts to the students. While this method ensures that important information is delivered clearly, it can sometimes feel less engaging, especially for students who thrive in more interactive environments. Still, teachers at City Central do make an effort to encourage participation by asking questions and creating space for students to share their ideas. This approach works well for some students but might not capture the interest of others who benefit from more creative, hands-on learning experiences.</p><br>
                <p>Overall, both schools have their strengths. ILS stands out for its creativity, use of technology, and strong classroom management, creating an environment where students are motivated and eager to learn. At City Central Elementary, the traditional teaching methods work for ensuring students receive important information, but there’s room for more variety in how lessons are delivered. Both approaches contribute to students’ growth in different ways, and finding a balance between creativity, technology, and effective classroom management is key to creating a learning environment where all students can thrive.</p><br>

            <button class="accordion">The Learning Environment</button>
            <div class="panel"><br>
                <p>At the Integrated Laboratory School (ILS), I observed that the classrooms are spacious and filled with natural light, creating a bright and inviting atmosphere. The good ventilation makes the air fresh, contributing to a comfortable space for students to learn. I saw that the classrooms are designed in a flexible way, allowing teachers to easily switch between different teaching styles, whether it’s group work or independent study. This setup encourages students to collaborate and engage with each other, which makes the learning experience feel more interactive and dynamic.</p><br>
                <p>I also observed how technology plays a big role in the learning environment at ILS.

            <button class="accordion">Instructional Materials</button>
            <div class="panel"><br>
                <p>At the Integrated Laboratory School (ILS), I noticed that the materials teachers use are really varied, which makes learning more interesting. Teachers mix in technology like interactive whiteboards, apps, and online tools to bring lessons to life. I saw how these tools help students engage with the material in different ways—whether it’s watching videos, taking online quizzes, or playing educational games. It’s not just about sitting and listening; students get to experience the lesson. This mix of materials keeps things fresh, helping students stay focused and remember what they learn.</p><br>
                <p>Even though technology is a big part of the classroom, traditional materials like textbooks, workbooks, and printed handouts are still important. These printed resources work alongside the digital tools, giving students a chance to practice and really apply what they’ve learned. For example, after a fun video or interactive game, students might use a workbook to dig deeper into the topic. This combination of tech and paper-based materials makes sure all students stay engaged and get the help they need to succeed.</p><br>
                <p>At City Central Elementary School, I saw that the materials are more traditional, but still work really well. Teachers rely on textbooks, chalkboards, and worksheets to guide lessons. While the classroom doesn’t have as much technology, these materials are clear and organized, helping students understand what’s being taught. Teachers also use visual aids like charts and flashcards to make concepts easier to understand, which helps students get a better grasp of the material.</p><br>
                <p>At City Central, even though the materials are more basic, teachers use them in hands-on ways.

            <button class="accordion">The Teaching-Learning Process</button>
            <div class="panel"><br>
                <p>At the Integrated Laboratory School (ILS), I observed that the teaching and learning process is very dynamic and interactive. Teachers don’t just stand in front of the class and talk; they encourage students to actively participate in lessons. I saw that lessons often start with an engaging activity—like a group discussion or an interactive video—that draws students in and gets them thinking. Teachers use a variety of methods to explain concepts, such as hands-on activities, digital tools, and visual aids. This approach keeps students engaged and allows them to learn in different ways, whether they are listening, touching, or seeing. The classroom feels more like a place where everyone is involved in learning, and students are encouraged to ask questions, share their ideas, and collaborate with their peers.</p><br>
                <p>Technology plays a big part in the teaching process at ILS. I observed that teachers use digital resources like interactive whiteboards and educational apps to make lessons more exciting and relevant. I saw students actively participating in activities on tablets or laptops, solving problems, and working on projects. These tools not only make learning more fun but also help students develop important skills that they will need in the future. The teaching at ILS is all about keeping the students engaged and providing them with opportunities to explore and learn in an interactive way.</p><br>
               <p>At City Central Elementary School, the teaching and learning process is more traditional but still effective. I noticed that teachers tend to focus on direct instruction, where they explain concepts and then ask students to practice or discuss what they’ve learned. Lessons usually begin with a clear explanation of the topic, followed by exercises or worksheets for students to complete. While the process is more teacher-centered, it works well for making sure all students understand the key points of the lesson. Teachers encourage participation by asking questions and having students share their answers, which helps create a sense of involvement even in this more structured environment.</p><br>
                <p>Even though the approach at City Central is more traditional, I observed that teachers still make efforts to make the learning experience engaging. They use visual aids to support their teaching. This helps students better understand the material by providing a visual representation of what’s being taught. While the lessons may be more focused on the teacher’s explanation, the students are still given opportunities to participate and practice what they’ve learned.<p><br>
                <p>Both schools have effective teaching and learning processes, though they approach it in different ways. At ILS, the focus is on creating a dynamic, interactive classroom where students are constantly engaged and involved in their learning. Technology plays a big role in making lessons more exciting and relevant. At City Central, the process is more traditional, with a stronger focus on direct instruction and structured activities, but it’s still effective in helping students learn the material. Both methods ensure that students are given the tools they need to succeed, even if they go about it in different ways.</p><br>

            <button class="accordion">Assessing Students' Learning</button>
            <div class="panel"><br>
                <p>At the Integrated Laboratory School (ILS), I observed that assessing student learning is an ongoing, interactive process. Teachers don’t just give one big test at the end of the lesson; they use a variety of methods to check understanding throughout the learning process. For example, I saw that teachers frequently use quizzes, group discussions, and even games to gauge how well students are grasping the material. These assessments are not just for grading, but are also a way for teachers to adjust their teaching if something isn’t quite working. Additionally, teachers use digital tools like interactive quizzes or instant feedback apps, allowing students to get immediate responses and helping them understand what they need to work on right away. This continuous and varied approach to assessment helps keep students on track and makes learning feel more like a two-way conversation between the teacher and the student.</p><br>
                <p>Another thing I noticed at ILS is how teachers assess students through projects and presentations. Rather than relying solely on written tests, students are often asked to work on group projects or present their findings to the class. This kind of assessment helps students apply what they've learned in a more real-world setting, and I saw how it encouraged students to think critically and creatively. It also gave them the chance to show their understanding in different ways, whether through writing, speaking, or collaborating with others.</p><br>
                <p>At City Central Elementary School, the assessment process is more traditional. I observed that teachers rely more on written tests, quizzes, and worksheets to assess student learning. While these methods may not be as interactive as those at ILS, they are still effective in helping teachers check if students have understood the material. I saw that teachers often go over the answers with the class after a quiz or test, making sure everyone understands any mistakes and reinforcing key concepts. This helps students learn from their errors and solidifies their understanding of the lesson.</p><br>
                <p>In addition to tests, I noticed that teachers at City Central also use oral questioning to assess students. They ask questions throughout the lesson to make sure students are following along and encourage participation by calling on different students to share their answers. This helps teachers gauge students' understanding and adjust their teaching if needed. Even though it’s more teacher-directed, I saw that these assessments still create opportunities for students to engage with the material and demonstrate their learning.</p><br>
                <p>Both schools have their own way of assessing student learning, but both are effective. At ILS, the focus is on using a variety of methods, including digital tools, projects, and real-time feedback, to assess students in an interactive and ongoing way. This makes learning feel like a continuous process. At City Central, the approach is more traditional, with written tests and quizzes, but it’s still a solid method for checking understanding. Both schools show that assessment is not just about giving grades; it's about helping students learn and grow by giving them the opportunity to reflect on and demonstrate their knowledge in different ways.</p><br>
